description: "Love and Mr Lewisham is an 1900 novel set in the 1880s by H. G. Wells.\
  \ It was among his first outside the science fiction genre. Wells took considerable\
  \ pains over the manuscript and said of it that \"the writing was an altogether\
  \ more serious undertaking than I have ever done before.\" He later included it\
  \ in a 1933 anthology entitled Stories of Men and Women in Love.\n\n\n From Wikipedia\
